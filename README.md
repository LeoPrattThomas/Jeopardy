# Jeopardy
### About
 Jeopardy game for SDA its here so people can read my Amazing code
yes i wrote all of this just for the game using:
    R
    Python
    SQL
    Django
I did write all of this so i am not completely incompetent.

but if you are reading this just for fun or i showed it to you and you are a part of UChicago Lab School and not a part of SDA JOIN!!! We do cool things. 
And yet somehow I'm stuck with writing code at 1:47 am in the morning. I need friends
It took over 2 days of code, i spent a lot of time gettign this to work, django is not a game dev platform, but im  not rewriting it and it works so yeah!

### Downloading a repository

<a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository"> GitHub Tutorial for Cloning a repository </a>

Run this code in terminal replacing "your directory" with an actual directory 
```
cd "your directory"
git clone https://github.com/LeoPrattThomas/Jeopardy.git
```

### To run this program:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
### R implementation
```
python3 manage.py shell
import R.code.import_all
```

Because it is all stored in a spreadsheet and I would like all of it to be stored in a database, I made an implementation to migrate it from one thing to another. so it should work with the given code above.
